          Adjusting at first seemed to be a mission. Everything was new for an
          international student like myself to adjust to living in the new
          city.<br />
          However, the moment I participated in SP online camp orientation, I
          was certain that this was going to be my second home for the next
          <br />three years. During the orientation, we were able to partake in
          a variety of games as an ice-breaker between the students and
          teachers.<br />We were also introduced to the wide range of workshops,
          and projects that were in place at SP. The karate workshop, in
          particular, stood<br />out to me. Taking an interest in the club, I
          participated in the training provided by my senior senseis and gained
          plenty of new experiences<br />and pleasant memories.
