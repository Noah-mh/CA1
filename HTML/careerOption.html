        <h3>Data Analytics</h3>
        <p>
          In this fast-paced world of digital marketing and cloud engineers,
          data analysts have merged<br />
          their way towards brighter and more efficient advancements in today's
          world of Information<br />
          Technology. I, for one, see this as an opportunity for me to utilise
          and enhance the knowledge I<br />
          acquired from SP. By engaging myself in such a rapidly evolving field,
          I will be able to learn and<br />
          improve my understanding throughout my years of work. Moreover, since
          this career is centred<br />
          on problem-solving and thinking outside the box, I look forward to
          taking on this challenge and<br />
          improving my skills as a professional data analyst.

        <h3>Back-End Developer</h3>
        <p>
          As a person with a keen interest in innovation, programming, and
          software development, no other job<br />
          can appeal to me more than becoming a back-end developer. By immersing
          myself in this line of<br />
          work, I intend to spread my creativity and resources to build websites
          and platforms that will help<br />
          companies service all types of industries.

        <h3>Mobile App Development</h3>
        <p>
          Ever since mobile phones have gained world-wide popularity within the
          last decades, there has<br />
          always been a constant need for new, fresh, and exciting apps for
          people to use. By working in<br />
          the mobile app development industry, I will not be tethered to work
          for a specific large<br />
          corporation, but instead work either freelance or with an organisation
          that allows remote work<br />
          from time to time. Moreover by engaging in this industry, I intend to
          build applications that will aid<br />
          people with their daily performances, either for practical use or for
          fun.

        <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
        <p>
          Starting with the fact that software engineering is one of the most
          growing fields in the ICT field, there<br />
          is guarantee that a student graduating from a ICT program like myself,
          will land a job in this line of<br />
          work. As a software developer, I will be able to provide solutions for
          users' complications, by either a<br />
          quick fix for some cases or more complex strategic solutions for
          others. Additionally, the teamwork<br />
          and leadership skills I have acquired during group projects at SP will
          definitely come in handy in this<br />
          field as projects are usually conducted in groups rather than as
          individuals.
