        <p>
          My name is Lwin Moe Htet. I was born and raised in Yangon, Myanmar but
          I moved to SIngapore 3 months<br />ago to pursue my degree in
          Information Technology at Singapore Polytechnic. I am a passionate
          person in<br />
          whatever work I do whether it is in the workplace or studies. My goal
          in life is to settle down with a secure job<br />
          in the Information Technology department, surrounded by good
          companions.

        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;Values and worths are a must for every single individual
          aiming to survive in today's society. Truly, I<br />would feel like a
          lost piece of a jigsaw puzzle if I do not possess any personal values.
          During my time in<br />Singapore Polytechnic, I have built on a number
          of values for use in my professional career. A set of core<br />values
          that I live by is commitment and resourcefulness. As an employee,
          being committed to the tasks<br />that I am assigned with will help
          improve the effectiveness in my line of work. Moreover, I believe
          my<br />
          value of resourcefulness will come in handy when it comes to providing
          ideas for projects in my future<br />work environment.

        <h3>Batminton</h3>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;Playing badminton has always been<br />mygo-to leisure
          activity whenever I am free.<br />Not only does playing badminton
          serve<br />as a form of physical exercise, but it also<br />gives an
          irreplaceable feeling of<br />happiness whenever I enter the court.<br />Badminton
          has been a big part of my life<br />
          for a very long time and I plan on playing<br />it consistently to
          support both my<br />physical and mental well-being.

          &emsp;&emsp;I have loved watching starting from<br> Naruto since I was a kid. I love
          to watch<br> all genres of anime such as Shonen,<br> Shoujo, Slice of Life,
          Sci-Fi, Adventure,<br> Horror, Psychological, Sports and so on.<br> Watching
          anime is the only time that I<br> relax and take a break from my works<br> and
          study.

        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;I have also taken a huge interest in<br />photography ever
          since I graduated from<br />high school. Having been given a
          digital<br />camera for my 17th birthday, I have<br />developed a
          hobby in capturing all sorts of<br />
          moments from people to landscapes. Most<br />of my favourite works
          include landscape<br />photographs of evening sunsets and emerging<br />moons,
          and I look forward to sharing my<br />work with the world one day.

      <p>
        As an individual, I am very optimistic and open-minded. I prefer seeing
        things from a positive point of view no matter how heated the
        situation<br />
        is, and I am always open to new ideas and opinions.I am also a
        considerate and protective person, and I always go above and beyond to
        protect<br />the ones that I love at all cost.
